NYC is the birthplace of comics in America.  The first published work of comics, "The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck," was published in the New York 
humor magazine, Brother Jonathan, in 1842.
Obadiah Oldbuck, of course, is a translation of the Swiss book, L'histoire de M. Vieux-Boix.  Within the next decade, Brother Jonathan would publish the first original American work of comics, "The Fortunes of Ferdinand Flipper."
